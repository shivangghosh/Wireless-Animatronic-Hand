# Wireless-Animatronic-Hand

## List of Components and Tools
* Arduino IDE
* Arduino NANO
* Servo motors
* Node MCUs
* Gyroscope Sensors
* Optical bend sensors


## About Animatronic Hand
- A design of a robotic hand that works as per info. received from the glove
- Glove consists of optical bend sensors
- Operation Performed : data received from the flex sensor is sent to the servomotor, the motor rotates to an angle


## Different parts of my work
- Mobility enabled platform controlled by an app
- Optical bend sensor deployed gloves 
- Servo motor controlled hand
- App controled camera(part of platform)

### Mobile Platform (Parts)
- Node MCU 
- Arduino NANO 
- Power converter 
- 60 Kg servo motors 
- Wheels
- Pots(10K)

### Gloves(Parts)
- Node MCU
- Gryoscope sensor
- Optical bend sensors

### Hand (Parts)
- 10 kg servo motors
- 60 kg servo motors

### Optical bend sensor
LED at one end of a clear plastic tube.
LDR at the other end.
When strip is bent, the less light reaches the LDR through the plastic strip.


## Different Motions Offered
- Wrist motion
- Elbow motion 
- Individual finger motion 
- mobility


## Applications
- In chemical fields to avoid skin damages
- In space for repair of space stations-remotely (future)
- Diffusion of bombs with these animatronic hands


## Merits
- Easy to handle in simple manner 
- Requires less maintenance
- No unemployment issues
- Ensures safeguard in different places


## Demerits
- Requires good level knowledge while operating
- Motion accuracy
- Delay


## Future Scope
- Can be made AI enabled
- Can be converted into a robot
- Can be deployed into several work areas 
- Can be made as CLCS
- Can be made as drone enabled
